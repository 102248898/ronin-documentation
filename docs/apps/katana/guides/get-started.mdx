## Overview

Before you can start using the Katana DEX, you'll need to have a Ronin wallet and activate it through the Axie marketplace.

## Get started

### Step 1. Download and set up Ronin Wallet

Download and install your Ronin Wallet by following the instructions on the [Ronin Wallet Overview](https://support.roninchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/21919788607131-Ronin-Wallet-Overview) page.
You should install both the Ronin Wallet browser extension and mobile app. 

### Step 2. Create your Axie Infinity account

Create your Axie Infinity account by following the instructions in the [Axie Infinity Account Creation](https://support.axieinfinity.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405373226779-Getting-Started-with-Axie-Infinity#h_01HTCKHNRGFXG8K7HQ33YK37A5) guide.

## Log in to Katana

1. Open the [Katana DEX](https://katana.roninchain.com/).
2. Connect your Ronin Wallet by clicking either of the **Connect Ronin Wallet** buttons.

You are now logged in.

## Check wallet balance

When you're logged in, you can see the amount of RON you own and the wallet address you're connected to.

Click your connected wallet to view the more details:

* The Ronin Wallet address you're connected to: To open the address's page in the Explorer, click the **View on Explorer** button. To copy the address to your clipboard, click the **Copy address** button.
* The **Disconnect** button: This disconnects your Ronin Wallet from the Katana DEX.

## Approve tokens

When a smart contract first interacts with a token in your wallet, it asks for your permission. You're prompted once for each token, and these prompts appear visibly before you can continue with your desired actions. 

For example, to swap USDC for PIXEL, you need to approve the USDC token first. Click **Approve**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.
