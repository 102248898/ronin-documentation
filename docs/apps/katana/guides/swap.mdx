## Overview

Swapping is the action of you trading one of your tokens for another token via a Decentralized Exchange (DEX for short). DEXs are apps that allow people to exchange between any two assets without the need of a traditional bank or other trusted third party by using smart contracts.

Katana DEX is an Automated Market Maker. This means it is always ready to buy and sell any tokens immediately.

## How to swap tokens

On the Katana swap page., you'll be presented with a simple Swap panel. You will first need to choose which tokens you want to swap from (top) and which to swap to (bottom).

You may click on either of the token selection boxes to reveal the full supported tokens. Choose the tokens you want to swap from and to.

Once you've chosen the swap pair, you will see them listed on the Swap panel. The top token is for the token you have in your wallet. The bottom token is for the one you want to swap your token with.

1. Specify how much you are swapping for (type in on one of the fields, the other will populate based on the current exchange rate between the tokens)
2. Switch the top and bottom tokens
3. Swap: when you are ready to swap, click this button

Once you've clicked the Swap button, you'll be presented with a "Confirm Swap" pop-up.

There are 3 sections in the Confirm Swap pop-ups:

* The tokens to be swapped. Ensure that the amounts are correct
* Detailed swap information:
    * Liquidity provider fee: The fees allocated to LP provider (0.3%)
    * Route: The trading route taken for your order. It could be direct (Token A -> Token B) or there might be a bridge (Token A -> Token B -> Token C). Direct route might not always be the cheapest.
    * Price Impact: Estimation of the slippage to expect based on your order size and market movements. This gives you an idea of how much you will likely receive.
    * Minimum received: The minimum amount of tokens you'll receive based on slippage tolerance. This is the worst case scenario, anything below this will result in a failed transaction.
    * Slippage tolerance: Maximum % of price movement of the transaction, anything above that will result in failed transaction.
* Confirm Swap button

Click on the Confirm Swap button when you have checked everything.
