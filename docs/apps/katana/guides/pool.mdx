## Overview

This guide describes how to contribute funds to liquidity pools on the Katana
decentralized exchange, enabling you to earn trading fees from the resulting
transactions.

By engaging as a Liquidity Provider (LP), you will deposit pairs
of tokens into a smart contract, effectively increasing the pool's liquidity.
For instance, if you decide to support the ETH-AXS pool, you'll need to
contribute an equivalent value of both tokens. In recognition of your
contribution, you receive LP tokens, which represent your share in the pool.
These tokens not only signify your stake but also entitle you to a portion
of the trading fees generated by the pool's transactions, directly
proportional to your contribution. 

Be aware that earning a profit through this method is not guaranteed.
You may face what is known as Impermanent Loss, a risk that arises from
fluctuations in the value of the deposited tokens.

## Prerequisites

Before you can provide liquidity, you need to deposit assets to Ronin. 
You can do this through Binance,
by depositing from Ethereum using the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge),
or buying tokens through the [Purchase](https://purchase.roninchain.com) website.

For more information, see [Deposit ERC20 tokens through Ronin Bridge](../../ronin-bridge/guides/deposit-token.md) and [Acquire RON](../../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).

## Add a liquidity pair

1. Open [Katana](https://katana.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Pool** tab and click **Add liquidity.** This takes you to the **Add Liquidity** page. It's similar to the **Swap** page, except you see a plus sign (+) between the two tokens instead of an arrow down sign (â†“). This symbolizes that you add both tokens to a pool.
3. Click **Select token.**
4. Choose the token you want to provide liquidity for.
